## 🧭 Upwork Long Description (SEO‑Optimized — Copy/Paste)

I built an interactive 3D portfolio website that showcases advanced frontend engineering with React, Three.js (WebGL), React Three Fiber, Framer Motion, and Matter.js. It features an animated GLB astronaut, a mouse‑responsive camera rig, physics‑based technology cards with real‑time collision, a performance‑tuned COBE globe, parallax backgrounds tied to smooth Lenis scrolling, and a Tailwind CSS UI. The app is production‑ready with Vite, lazy loading, and mobile‑first performance optimizations.

What this project demonstrates for clients looking for a MERN/Next.js developer:
- React 19 architecture with clean, reusable components and Suspense fallbacks
- WebGL/Three.js proficiency (R3F + Drei), GLTF asset loading, lighting, and camera control
- Framer Motion animations with custom easing, spring dynamics, and scroll‑linked effects
- Real‑time physics via Matter.js (gravity, constraints, collision boundaries, sleeping)
- Lenis integration with Motion Values for buttery, scroll‑based parallax and section reveals
- Performance engineering: DPR capping, reduced samples for globe, conditional/mobile tuning
- Tailwind CSS 4 for responsive design, design tokens, and utility composition
- Modern build tooling with Vite for fast dev, optimized production bundles, and code splitting

Key interactive experiences your users will notice:
- 3D Hero: Animated astronaut in a WebGL canvas with a camera that subtly follows cursor movement
- Physics Tech Cards: Draggable, colliding cards that respect walls, inertia, gravity, and sleep states
- Parallax Backgrounds: Motion‑driven layers synced to Lenis scroll for depth without jank
- Interactive Globe: COBE globe with tuned samples and markers for balanced visual quality vs. FPS

Advanced concepts applied:
- Scene graph thinking and camera rigging with easing.damp and requestAnimationFrame
- Scroll orchestration: Bridging Lenis events → Motion Values → framer‑motion transforms
- Visibility‑based work scheduling using IntersectionObserver (pause/resume physics when off‑screen)
- Mobile adaptations: reduced physics iterations, lighter gravity, touch multipliers for smoothness
- Asset loading strategy: Suspense fallbacks for 3D content; progressive, responsive rendering

Stack & tools included (for search and relevance): React, Next.js (experience‑ready), MERN stack (experience‑ready), Three.js, React Three Fiber, Drei, Framer Motion, Motion, Matter.js, COBE, Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, Vite, Lenis, EmailJS.

Why this matters for product teams:
- Higher engagement: Immersive 3D and micro‑interactions keep users exploring longer
- Performance first: Smooth 60fps‑target visuals with mobile‑aware tuning and lazy loading
- Maintainable: Modular components, clear separation of concerns, and modern tooling
- Versatile: The same techniques translate to marketing sites, product tours, dashboards, and docs

Ideal project types I can deliver:
- 3D/interactive landing pages, developer portfolios, product demos, data‑driven visuals
- Next.js + MERN applications with rich UI/UX, API integration, and modern frontend architecture
